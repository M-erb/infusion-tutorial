  "text": "How the web works basically is that your internet provider gives your computer a 'route' when you goto a web site. These routes are bounced off servers on the web to get you where you want to go. Not all routes are created equal though, and some can be slower than others, and there are different roures to get to different web sites. What a Traceroute does is show us exactly what path or 'route' your internet provider is giving your computer to get there and how long it is taking at each stop. This will help so much in finding out why this is happening. Once you get that please take a screen shot or copy the results and give this to me.",
